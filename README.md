# correct

Hey Jerry, so the Index.html, style.css and the main.js are the normal html, css and JS code. 
you can run it to see the transition i am talking about. Converting html and css files to
react i know how to do that, so kinda ignore the code you see in the signUp.js file.
what I dont fully understand is how to handle event in react.
Pls help me out.
Try seeing if you can help me achieve the transitioning while i study your code as well as
read online resources.

Thanks.
